# discord-stonks

This repo looks at data scraped from several different discord-based stock chat groups and that data's relation to the market.

I use mostly linear regression to uncover relationships because results are more interpretable in low signal/noise ratios.

I have not found signicant innefficiencies yet, but will post my progress here.
